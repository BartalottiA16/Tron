Ticklish Penguin
================

Your program is to write a program that moves something in a random walk. Your program doesn't have to look or work like my example. Any sort of random walk is fine. Check the samples of student work at the bottom for some ideas. Have fun and be creative!

While you could use your picture from the penguin assignment, you may find it easier to move a simpler object like an ellipse or a point. You could also move an image, see the `image()` example at [processing.org](https://processing.org/reference/PImage.html) to get started. Once you've choosen what picture or object you want, make sure you can see it on the screen. Then make sure you can move your image or picture by changing it's x and y coordinates. Since the x and y coordinates of the picture or object will be changing, we will need variables for each. Now, add code in `void draw()`, change the variables that hold the x and y coordinates a small amount using `random()` every time the mouse is pressed.
